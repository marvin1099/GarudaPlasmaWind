# GarudaPlasmaWind

My default setup for new users on plasma (mainly for garuda).  
Its more like windows, a bit better to get into linux coming from windows.


# Usage
Click one of the links:  
[Repo downloads and click on the file download-and-set-settings.sh to download it](https://codeberg.org/marvin1099/GarudaPlasmaWind/releases)  
[Here the Backup repo downloads also click on the file download-and-set-settings.sh to download it](https://codeberg.org/marvin1099/GarudaPlasmaWind/releases)  

Alternatively you can also use git clone to get the repo.  
A bit more complex (do this only if you know how to).

The downloaded file should be named download-and-set-settings.sh and in your downloads folder.  
To run "right click" the downloaded file and open Propertys (last option in plasma).  
In there enable "file execution" under the permission tab.   
Then close that Propertys window and double / single click the file (depends on your settings).  
Then it should ask you the execute, click yes / execute.  
in a few seconds the configs will be installed.  
Now logout and then log back in.  
The settings should now be applied.
